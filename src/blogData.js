      <p>In this post, I'll share my experience building this blog with React.</p>

      <h2>Why React?</h2>
      <p>React is a powerful library for building user interfaces. It makes it easy to create reusable components and manage application state.</p>

      <h2>The Tech Stack</h2>
      <p>For this blog, I used:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>React - UI library</li>
        <li>React Router - Navigation between pages</li>
        <li>CSS - Styling</li>
        <li>GitHub Pages - Free hosting</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What's Next?</h2>
      <p>I'm planning to add more features like tags, search, and maybe even comments in the future.</p>
